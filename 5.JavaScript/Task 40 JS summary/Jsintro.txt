Just a short summary for javascript
important timeline and updates in javascript

-1995:JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape. It was first called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.

1997-JavaScript was standardized as ECMAScript (ES) by ECMA International (to ensure all browsers follow the same rules).

2009-Node.js was released — allowing JavaScript to run on servers. 

2015-Big update: ES6 (ECMAScript 6) introduced modern features like let, const, arrow functions, classes, etc.

Now-JavaScript is one of the most popular languages for web development, used in both frontend and backend.

-Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich
First called Mocha → LiveScript → JavaScript
Standardized as ECMAScript (ES)
Used in browsers and servers (with Node.js)
Constantly evolving with new features (ES6, ES7, etc.)

Introduction to JavaScript

-Basically javascript is a programming language that makes websites interactive and alive
-It runs in the browser which means when you click buttons, open menus, or see animations-that's often JavaScript at work
-It is also higher level programming language, which is interpreted
-JS support both approches (POP, OOP)

Why Do We Use JavaScript:

-Without JS, websites would be just plain pages with only text and images (like a book)

-With JS, we can:

Create interactive buttons
Show pop-ups and alerts
Make games and apps
Update content without reloading the page

Scope:

-web development(ExpressReactNode), mobile development(React Native), desktop development(Electron.js)

(client side js / server side js)

-Client-side JS means JavaScript code runs in the browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) on the user’s computer.

Used For:
Showing or hiding content
Handling button clicks
Validating forms (like checking email format)
Animations and effects
Live content updates (without page reload)

-Server-side JS means JavaScript runs on a server using tools like Node.js.It’s used to handle data, connect to databases, and manage the backend of web applications.

Used For:
Saving form data
Sending emails
Getting data from a database
User login and authentication
Making APIs work

Easy Way to Remember:
Client-side JS = Works on your screen
Server-side JS = Works behind the scenes

-dynamically typed language (JS, Python) 
/ Static typed language(C , C++, JAVA, TypeScritp)
