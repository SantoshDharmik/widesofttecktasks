Difference between Expression and Statement

1. Expression:
-An expression is anything that produces a value.
-It can be stored in a variable or used inside other expressions.
Examples:
5 + 3              // 8 (Expression)
"Hello"            // String Expression
a = 10             // Assignment Expression
-Expressions return a value.

 2. Statement
-A statement performs an action.
-It may contain expressions inside it.
-It controls the flow of the program.
Examples:
let x = 5;         // Variable declaration (Statement)
if (x > 0) {       // if statement
console.log(x);  // another statement
}
-Statements do not return a value directly â€” they just do something.

let we consider 
js

let a = 10;       // Statement
let b = a + 5;    // Statement (contains expression `a + 5`)

-a + 5 is an expression (gives value)
-let b = a + 5; is a statement (performs the action of assigning)
